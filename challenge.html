<h2>Low and Slow </h2>
<p>posted by BGB November 15,2016</p>
This week i am <em>extremely </em>excited about a new cooking technique called<em> sous vide.</em> In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,you submerged the food(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<em>cooking for geeks</em>,jeff porter describes it as ultra-low poaching 
<P>Next month,we will be serving <strong><em>sous vide</em> salmon with Dil Hollandaise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table contact us before November 30.</P>
